    "Our team of researchers has integrated playing statistics from the 2012 season. The updated version contains complete batting and pitching statistics back to 1871, plus fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. For more details on the latest release, please read the documentation.\n",

    "Please help support the Baseball Archive. The database is free, but there are real costs associated with maintaining it and making it available for download. The more popular this site becomes, the more expensive it is to keep things going. Please consider making a donation as a show of your support. Like the PBS folks say, we need your support if we’re going to survive. Click here for more information.\n",

    "### 1.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This database contains pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics for\n",
    "Major League Baseball from 1871 through 2012.  It includes data from\n",
    "the two current leagues (American and National), the four other \"major\"\n",
    "leagues (American Association, Union Association, Players League, and\n",
    "Federal League), and the National Association of 1871-1875.\n",
    "\n",
    "This database was created by Sean Lahman, who pioneered the effort to\n",
    "make baseball statistics freely available to the general public. What\n",
    "started as a one man effort in 1994 has grown tremendously, and now a\n",
    "team of researchers have collected their efforts to make this the\n",
    "largest and most accurate source for baseball statistics available\n",
    "anywhere. (See Acknowledgements below for a list of the key\n",
    "contributors to this project.)\n",
    "\n",
    "None of what we have done would have been possible without the\n",
    "pioneering work of Hy Turkin, S.C. Thompson, David Neft, and Pete\n",
    "Palmer (among others).  All baseball fans owe a debt of gratitude\n",
    "to the people who have worked so hard to build the tremendous set\n",
    "of data that we have today.  Our thanks also to the many members of\n",
    "the Society for American Baseball Research who have helped us over\n",
    "the years.  We strongly urge you to support and join their efforts.\n",
    "Please vist their website (www.sabr.org).\n",
    "\n",
    "This database can never take the place of a good reference book like\n",
    "The Baseball Encyclopedia.  But it will enable people do to the kind\n",
    "of queries and analysis that those traditional sources don't allow.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any problems or find any errors, please let us know.  Any\n",
    "feedback is appreciated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What's New in 2012\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been significant cleanup in the master file\n",
    "\n",
    "MLB's addition of wildcard games in 2012 adds two new types of records\n",
    "to the post-season files.  The abbreviations ALWC and NLWC are used to\n",
    "denote each league's wild card game.\n",
    "\n",
    "Added the MLB \"Comeback Player of the Year\" award to the awards table\n",
    "\n",
    "Florida Marlins changed their name to the Miami Marlins, new team abbr is MIA\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Acknowledgements\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the raw data contained in this database comes from the work of\n",
    "Pete Palmer, the legendary statistician, who has had a hand in most\n",
    "of the baseball encylopedias published since 1974. He is largely\n",
    "responsible for bringing the batting, pitching, and fielding data out\n",
    "of the dark ages and into the computer era.  Without him, none of this\n",
    "would be possible.  For more on Pete's work, please read his own\n",
    "account at: http://sabr.org/cmsfiles/PalmerDatabaseHistory.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Two people have been key contributors to the work that followed, first\n",
    "by taking the raw data and creating a relational database, and later\n",
    "by extending the database to make it more accesible to researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean Lahman launched the Baseball Archive's website back before\n",
    "most people had heard of the world wide web.  Frustrated by the\n",
    "lack of sports data available, he led the effort to build a\n",
    "baseball database that everyone could use. Baseball researchers\n",
    "everywhere owe him a debt of gratitude.  Lahman served as an associate\n",
    "editor for three editions of Total Baseball and contributed to five\n",
    "editions of The ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia. He has also been active in\n",
    "developing databases for other sports.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work of Sean Forman to create and maintain an online encyclopedia\n",
    "at \"baseball-reference.com\" has been remarkable. Recognized as the\n",
    "premier online reference source, Forman's site provides an oustanding\n",
    "interface to the raw data. His efforts to help streamline the database\n",
    "have been extremely helpful. Most importantly, Forman has spearheaded\n",
    "the effort to provide standards that enable several different baseball\n",
    "databases to be used together. He was also instrumental in launching\n",
    "the Baseball Databank, a forum for researchers to gather and share\n",
    "their work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 2001, these two Seans have led a group of researchers\n",
    "who volunteered to maintain and update the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A handful of researchers have made substantial contributions to\n",
    "maintain this database in recent years. Listed alphabetically, they\n",
    "are: Derek Adair, Mike Crain, Kevin Johnson, Rod Nelson, Tom Tango,\n",
    "and Paul Wendt. These folks did much of the heavy lifting, and are\n",
    "largely responsible for the improvements made in the last decade.\n",
    "\n",
    "Others who made important contributions include: Dvd Avins,\n",
    "Clifford Blau, Bill Burgess, Clem Comly, Jeff Burk, Randy Cox,\n",

    "Theron Skyles, Hans Van Slootenm, Michael Westbay, and Rob Wood.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many other people have made significant contributions to the database\n",
    "over the years.  The contribution of Tom Ruane's effort to the overall\n",
    "quality of the underlying data has been tremendous. His work at\n",
    "retrosheet.org integrates the yearly data with the day-by-day data,\n",
    "creating a reference source of startling depth. It is unlikely than\n",
    "any individual has contributed as much to the field of baseball\n",
    "research in the past five years as Ruane has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sean Holtz helped with a major overhaul and redesign before the\n",
    "2000 season. Keith Woolner was instrumental in helping turn\n",
    "a huge collection of stats into a relational database in the mid-1990s.\n",
    "Clifford Otto & Ted Nye also helped provide guidance to the early\n",
    "versions. Lee Sinnis, John Northey & Erik Greenwood helped supply key\n",
    "pieces of data. Many others have written in with corrections and\n",
    "suggestions that made each subsequent version even better than what\n",
    "preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The work of the SABR Baseball Records Committee, led by Lyle Spatz\n",
    "has been invaluable.  So has the work of Bill Carle and the SABR\n",
    "Biographical Committee. David Vincent, keeper of the Home Run Log and\n",
    "other bits of hard to find info, has always been helpful. The recent\n",
    "addition of colleges to player bios is the result of much research by\n",
    "members of SABR's Collegiate Baseball committee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Salary data has been supplied by Doug Pappas, who passed away during\n",
    "the summer of 2004. He was the leading authority on many subjects,\n",
    "most significantly the financial history of Major League Baseball.\n",
    "We are grateful that he allowed us to include some of the data he\n",
    "compiled.  His work has been continued by the SABR Business of\n",
    "Baseball committee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks is also due to the staff at the National Baseball Library\n",
    "in Cooperstown who have been so helpful -- Tim Wiles, Jim Gates,\n",
    "Bruce Markusen, and the rest of the staff.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special debt of gratitude is owed to Dave Smith and the folks at\n",
    "Retrosheet. There is no other group working so hard to compile and\n",
    "share baseball data.  Their website (www.retrosheet.org) will give\n",
    "you a taste of the wealth of information Dave and the gang have collected.\n",

    "The 2012 database beneifited from the work of Ted Turocy and his\n",

    "### SQL Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SELECT\n",
    "\n",
    "The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "• The basic syntax is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "<columns>\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT [DISTINCT | ALL]\n",
    "{* | [columnExpression [AS newName]] [,...]\n",
    "}\n",
    "FROM TableName [alias] [, ...]\n",
    "[WHERE condition]\n",
    "[GROUP BY columnList] [HAVING condition]\n",
    "[ORDER BY columnList]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT` is followed by the names of the columns in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT` is always paired with `FROM`, which identifies the table from which we're retrieving the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "<columns>\n",
    "FROM\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`SELECT *` returns *all* of the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp example:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "* \n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews;\n",
    "```\n",
    "`SELECT <columns>` returns *some* of the columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Yelp example:\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "review_id, text, stars\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### WHERE\n",
    "\n",
    "`WHERE`, which follows the `FROM` clause, is used to filter tables using specific criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "<columns>\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "review_id, text, stars\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews \n",
    "WHERE stars > 2 and useful != 0;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "LIMIT\n",
    "\n",
    "Limit caps the number of rows returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "review_id, text, stars\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews \n",
    "WHERE stars > 2\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "WHERE stars > 2;\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Order of Operations  \n",
    "\n",
    "The order of operation is the same as in algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Whatever is in parentheses is executed first. If parentheses are nested, the innermost is executed first, then the next most inner, etc.  \n",
    "2. Then all division and multiplication left to right.   \n",
    "3. And finally all addition and subtraction left to right.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregations (or aggregate functions) are functions in which the values of multiple rows are grouped together as an input on certain criteria to form a single value of more significant meaning or measurement. Examples are sets, bags, or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate funtions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Average (i.e., arithmetic mean)\n",
    "- Count\n",
    "- Maximum\n",
    "- Minimum\n",
    "- Median\n",
    "- Mode\n",
    "- Sum\n",
    "\n",
    "In SQL, they are performed in a `SELECT` statement like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT COUNT(useful)\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "AVG(stars), MAX(funny), MIN(cool)\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "AVG(stars), MAX(funny), MIN(cool)\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews;\n",
    "WHERE stars > 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aliasing \n",
    "\n",
    "• Sometimes it is useful to alias a column name to make a more\n",
    "readable result set.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT AVG(stars) AS Avg_Rating\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "• The AS keyword is optional.\n",
    "• Double quotes “ “ can be used instead of square brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Like  \n",
    "\n",
    "• The LIKE keyword used in a WHERE operator with a wildcard (% or _)\n",
    "allows you to search for patterns in character-based fields.  \n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "review_id, text, stars, stars+funny+useful+cool\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "WHERE text LIKE '%Boston%';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Between  \n",
    "\n",
    "• The BETWEEN keyword can be used in criteria to return values\n",
    "between to other values.\n",
    "• BETWEEN is inclusive of its ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "review_id, text, stars, stars+funny+useful+cool\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "WHERE date BETWEEN ’11/1/2016’ AND\n",
    "‘10/03/2017’;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NULL  \n",
    "\n",
    "• Nulls are special cases. They are not a value and so cannot be\n",
    "compared to a value using = or < or >.\n",
    "• To locate nulls you can use the IS keyword in a criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "review_id, text, stars, stars+funny+useful+cool\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "WHERE text IS NULL\n",
    "```\n",

    "review_id, text, stars, stars+funny+useful+cool\n",
    "FROM yelp_reviews\n",
    "WHERE text IS NOT NULL\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Subqueries  \n",
    "\n",
    "• Some SQL statements can have a SELECT embedded\n",
    "within them.\n",
    "• A subselect can be used in WHERE and HAVING\n",
    "clauses of an outer SELECT, where it is called a\n",
    "subquery or nested query.\n",
    "• Subselects may also appear in INSERT, UPDATE, and\n",
    "DELETE statements.\n"
